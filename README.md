# Markov Models
Utilizes Hidden Markov models and Viterbi decoding to tag parts of speech (POS) of sentences. The project's goal is to build a personal digital assistant (or at least the part of the speech understanding problem that such an assistant would need to handle).

## Overview
A POS tagger labels each word in a sentence with its part of speech (noun, verb, etc.). This project uses a Hidden Markov model approach, where the states are tags and the observations are words.
